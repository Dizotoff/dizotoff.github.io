I'm polishing the last design parts for my blog and here is a first post. That's quite exciting! Here I want to briefly explain my motivation to start a blog and also my concerns regarding it.

First of all, I decided to try blogging to analyze and sort through ideas. Blogging helps with analyzing what's important in massive blocks of information which one receives every day plus increases attention to details.

Secondly, I need to admit that I have concerns regarding my English writing skills. It takes some time for me to deliver a large amount of grammatically correct and readable text. It's hard to keep the grammar right while maintaining a stream of consciousness in different languages. I believe the blog can help with it too.

Finally, habits are the building blocks of our life. My hope is this blog will provide the motivation and discipline to write to help me develop the habits of the mind of an intellectual craftsman.

My blog is one of the millions of others, so no one probably ends up reading this, but I don't mind.
