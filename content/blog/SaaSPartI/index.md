For the ones who don't know what is SaaS, here is a brief explanation from Wikipedia:

> Software as a service (SaaS) is a software
> licensing and delivery model in which software is
> licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted.
> It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software",
> and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft.

I was always wondered by the possibility of mobile developers to make apps for the app stores and gain a lot of users because how easy it's to install or pay for the app. That was until that moment when I realized that being a full-stack dev was much cooler. Full-stack can ship the whole product by themself. And most importantly, they do not depend on the app stores which dictates you the rules and owns you.

I decided that it's time for me to ship a product. There are several reasons for that:

- Reason 1. SaaS is cool. I want to have one -
  The lightweight method of shipping digital web apps is just awesome. I can create an app and people can run it without any downloading or installation.

- Reason 2. Develop my skillset -
  For this project, I'm going to pick a new language for me - Typescript. Also, I'm planning to learn project management.

- Reason 3. Develop my portfolio -
  Currently, I have only a couple of portfolio projects on GitHub, but almost nothing with real users or done with a real purpose in mind. It was basically just to develop my skills and show off.

With this in mind, I can't really fail if my project won't succeed in terms of real users, because I'll develop my skillset and portfolio in the end. It is a win-win situation. Also, by putting everything here in the blog and on twitter, by sharing everything I learned with others, I'm making a contribution to other learners/developers/seekers because I open the doors to share the process of learning, not only the final product.

## The idea

So I had been partying once at the music festival and noticed that it was way too complicated to have a visual artist there who would be responsible for audio responsive visuals. First of all, you need a quite qualified person who can generate those visuals for you. Secondly, you need appropriate gear, because usually to generate those on the go you need a line input with a sound to which visuals would response. Lastly, you need the software which would actually link the sound and visuals. Currently, it's not free and overly complicated.

My solution to this problem would be a web platform that generates visuals based on the sound input from the computer's mic with the possibility to create own visuals and share them with others and interactively perform live. Imaging playing the instrument, but instead of sounds it creates visuals. I created an early prototype for a local music event and performed with it around a year ago. Here are some videos:

At that time, I needed to drop the project because of personal reasons. Now, I'm back with even some real-world dev experience behind my shoulders. In the next article I'm going to discuss technical stack I'm going to use, mvp acception criteria and project ideation.
